Realm of the Mad God Networking C# Library	Realm of the Mad God Networking C# Library


You can use this library to implement your own Realm of the Mad God bots.	RotMG-Net-Lib is an updated and fully working C# port of the RotMG networking logic. 


Check this if you want to use Java library: https://github.com/tripleys/RotMG-Net-JLib	It is used in our [community-driven RotMG port](https://github.com/RealmDev/RotMG-Clone).


Example class:	
```csharp	
    class Program	
    {	
        static void Main(string[] args)

                KeyTime = 0,	
                Key = new byte[0]	
            };	
            NetClient client = new NetClient(reconnect);	
            client.Hook(PacketType.Failure, (p) =>
